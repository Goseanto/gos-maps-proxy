# Goseanto Maps Proxy — AWS-Native Cost Optimizer for Google Maps

A lightweight, AWS-hosted routing layer that sits in front of **Google Maps Distance Matrix** and **Directions APIs**.

> **Cut your Google Maps API bill by 30–60%** — without changing a single line of code.

- Keep your existing Google Maps integration  
- Just redirect calls to our secure gateway  
- Instant savings through intelligent caching

## 💰 How It Saves You Money

**Before (direct to Google):**
Google often charges per element, not per call.
A single Distance Matrix request can contain 4, 16, 100+ elements — and each element is billable.
- Unit A → 20 elements → $0.10–$0.20  
- Unit B → 20 elements → $0.10–$0.20  
- Unit C → 20 elements → $0.10–$0.20  
→ **Identical calls multiply your cost**

**After (with Goseanto Proxy):**
- First unique request → sent to Google
- Next identical requests (within 10–20 seconds) → served instantly from **AWS cache**  
- Cache window is shorter than Google’s traffic refresh cycle
- **We stay inside Google’s own traffic refresh cycle (2–7 minutes)**
    → meaning cached responses are still 100% accurate

**Result:**
- Same real-time Google data
- **Dramatically fewer billable API calls**
- **Typical savings: 30–60%** (often higher during peak traffic)

## 🛡️ Trusted AWS-Native Architecture

Fully hosted on **Amazon Web Services** — no servers to manage:

| Component         | Technology                  | Benefit                              |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Entry point       | API Gateway                 | Secure, per-customer HTTPS endpoints |
| Processing        | AWS Lambda (Go)             | Auto-scaling, stateless, fast        |
| Caching & Metrics | DynamoDB                    | Sub-millisecond reads, fully managed |
| Monitoring        | CloudWatch + Alarms         | Real-time dashboards & alerts        |
| Encryption        | AWS KMS                     | Data protection at rest & in transit |

## ⚠️ Built-in Reliability & Smart Fallback

We never compromise accuracy — but we protect your app from failures and overloads::

- If Google returns 5xx or times out → serve **last known good result**
- Background refresh when Google recovers
- Burst protection: identical flood requests from CAD units are automatically deduplicated
- Zero delays, zero dropped responses

Your users never see blank screens — even during peak load or external outages.

## 🌍 Regional Deployment & Compliance

Deploy in your preferred AWS region — data stays where you need it:

| Region                | Location            | Compliance Support                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `ca-central-1`        | 🇨🇦 Canada            | PIPEDA + provincial privacy laws       |
| US regions            | 🇺🇸 United States     | HIPAA-eligible architecture            |
| EU regions            | 🇪🇺 European Union    | GDPR-compliant data handling           |
| `sa-east-1`           | 🇧🇷 Brazil            | LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados)  |

- Deployment time: typically under 1 hour (fully automated infrastructure)
- Custom regions available on request  
- No cross-region data replication unless explicitly approved  
- Minimal data processed: only coordinates (no PII/PHI required)

**Recommended: POST + JSON body**
 ✅ Option A — JSON Body (recommended)
```http
POST https://maps.goseanto.com/eta?key=YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "origins": ["45.5017,-73.5673"],
  "destinations": ["45.5081,-73.5550"],

      ?origin=45.5017,-73.5673
      &destination=45.5081,-73.5550
      &mode=driving
      &traffic=true

## 🔄 Zero operational risk - Failover Pattern (Recommended)
Use our proxy as primary.
If any error → fallback to Google.

Pseudocode:
```javascript
try {
  return callGoseanto();
} catch {
  return callGoogle();
}
```
---

### 🧩Architecture (High Level)

Your app → Goseanto Maps Proxy → Google Maps

Roughly:

* Your application sends standard Google-compatible requests
* Our secure gateway processes them using our proprietary optimization engine
* Google is called only when necessary
* Cached responses return in a few milliseconds (faster than calling Google directly)
* Live Google calls add only a minimal overhead (usually <10–20 ms)
* Responses are returned in Google-compatible JSON, so no code changes on your side

| Scenario                                     | What the App Sends               | Key Changes? | Google Call?                | Freshness           | Why It’s Fresh                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identical request repeated (TTL = 1–20s)** | `origin=A, dest=B, traffic=true` | ❌            | ❌ (cache or burst collapse) | **Fresh**           | TTL (1–20s) is far below Google’s 2–7 min traffic refresh → identical request = identical result                    |
| **Identical request repeated (TTL = 0)**     | `origin=A, dest=B, traffic=true` | ❌            | ❌ (burst collapse only)     | **Fresh**           | Even with TTL=0, concurrent identical calls collapse to **one Google call**; traffic changes only every few minutes |
| **Origin changes**                           | `origin=A' , dest=B`             | ✅            | ✅                           | **100% fresh**      | New origin → new geometry → requires fresh computation                                                              |
| **Destination changes**                      | `origin=A, dest=B'`              | ✅            | ✅                           | **100% fresh**      | Destination moved → new route → requires new Google call                                                            |
| **Traffic mode changes**                     | `traffic=true/false`             | ✅            | ✅                           | **100% fresh**      | Traffic models differ → cannot reuse cached or collapsed result                                                     |
| **Waypoints change**                         | New intermediate points          | ✅            | ✅                           | **100% fresh**      | Route topology changed → recomputation needed                                                                       |
| **Departure time changes**                   | `now` vs `now + X`               | Usually      | Usually                     | **100% fresh**      | Time-dependent routing → requires recalculation                                                                     |
| **Google outage**                            | Any input                        | N/A          | ❌                           | **Last known good** | Proxy serves LKG; background refresh happens when Google returns                                                    |

* TTL (Time-To-Live)      -  A very short reuse window (0–20 seconds). If two identical requests arrive close together, we reuse the first result. This does not affect accuracy — Google updates traffic only every 2–7 minutes.
* Key Changes           -  Anything that changes the route, such as: different origin or destination, different waypoints, traffic flag changes, different departure time. 
* Last Known Good (LKG)-  If Google is down or slow, we return the most recent valid result so your app never breaks.
